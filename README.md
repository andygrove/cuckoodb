DataFusion is a distributed data processing platform implemented in Rust. It is very much inspired by Apache Spark and has a similar programming style through the use of DataFrames and SQL.

DataFusion can also be used as a crate dependency in your project if you want the ability to perform SQL queries and DataFrame style data manipulation in-process against your own data sources. In that respect, DataFusion is inspired by Apache Calcite in the Java world.

# Project Home Page

The project home page is now at [https://datafusion.rs](https://datafusion.rs) and contains the [roadmap](https://datafusion.rs/roadmap) as well as documentation for using this crate or running DataFusion as a distributed cluster. I am using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/andygrove/datafusion-rs/issues) to track development tasks and feedback.

# Gitter

There is a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/datafusion-rs/Lobby) where you can ask questions about the project or make feature suggestions too.
