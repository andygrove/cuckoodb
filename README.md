DataFusion is a SQL parser, planner, and query execution library for Rust. A DataFrame API is also provided.

The following features are currently supported:

- SQL Parser, Planner and Optimizer
- DataFrame API
- Columnar processing using [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)
- Support for local CSV and [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) files
- Single-threaded execution of SQL queries, supporting:
  - Projection
  - Selection
  - Scalar Functions
  - Aggregates (Min, Max, Count)
  - Grouping
- User-defined Scalar Functions (UDFs)

DataFusion can be used as a crate dependency in your project to add SQL support for custom data sources.

A [Docker image](https://datafusion.rs/guides/getting-started-docker/) is also available if you just want to run SQL queries against your CSV and Parquet files.

I have plans to make DataFusion a fully distributed compute platform with features similar to Apache Spark, but I need help from contributors to get there.

# Project Home Page

The project home page is now at [https://datafusion.rs](https://datafusion.rs) and contains the [roadmap](https://datafusion.rs/roadmap) as well as documentation for using this crate. I am using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/datafusion-rs/datafusion-rs/issues) to track development tasks and feedback.

# Prerequisites

- Rust nightly (required by `parquet-rs` crate)

# Building DataFusion

See [BUILDING.md](/BUILDING.md).

# Gitter

There is a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/datafusion-rs/Lobby) where you can ask questions about the project or make feature suggestions too.
